## About
This basic machine learning model is trained on the
[Brain Tumor (MRI Scans) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans)
and is able to recognize and accurately classify brain tumors in MRI scans.
<br>
It utilizes PyTorch's neural networks and Tensor libraries for training the model, pandas for loading
and handling the dataset, Pillow for loading and converting the images, and Matplotlib
for visualizing the training results.
